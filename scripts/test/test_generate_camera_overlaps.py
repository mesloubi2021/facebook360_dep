"""Unit test class for GenerateCameraOverlaps.

This class subclasses the DepTest class, which provides some utility functions around
the base unittest.TestCase class. This script can be run as part of the overall test suite
via run_tests.py or standalone.

Example:
    To run the test independently (which will produce the standard Python unittest success
    output), simply run:

        $ python test_generate_camera_overlaps.py \
          --binary_dir=/path/to/facebook360_dep/build/bin \
          --dataset_root=s3://example/dataset
